----------------- Notes -----------------
 * Ast parser still has issues with whitespace
    * Breakes with `{a = 2 == 2 ? asd :  0 - 123;}` and `x += 1 + 2`
    * IT'S DEFINATLEY PRE EXCLUSIONS
    * large amounts of whitespace may be messing up pre_excludes, offsets may not be correct.
    * VERY broken....

 * Ambiguous syntax for `a = a == 2 ? somevar += 123 : 0;`. Currently just breaks.
 * lengths of ssbos still need to be determined
 * Null bodys for 'for' loop ect. 


 * To be done in postproc
    * continue replaces, replaces to JMP to previous continuable label
    * goto replacements
    * break replacements, replaces to JMP to next breakable label
    * switch cases replacement.

* Multiple passes is difinitley the go.
